# Disease-prediction-IBS-
Predict diseases from symptoms using supervised machine learning techniques. This project is part of a bioinformatics course. Users can upload or integrate their own dataset to test and adapt the model.
# Disease Prediction from Symptoms using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict possible diseases based on a list of symptoms. Built as part of a Bioinformatics coursework, it is a foundational implementation that can be extended with domain-specific datasets and features.

##  Key Features
- Input symptoms to predict disease names
- Modular code for easy dataset integration
- Machine learning models used: (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes â€” update based on your code)

##  Dataset
**Dataset not included.**  
Users are encouraged to upload or integrate their own datasets related to symptoms and diseases. The model can be retrained using `pandas`-compatible `.csv` files with proper feature formatting.

##  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, scikit-learn, etc. *(List all your dependencies)*

##  Usage
1. Upload your dataset
2. Run the notebook
3. Modify the code as per your data structure
